# Lyriks

## Description

This project was created to showcase my front-end development abilities.  Using the React.js framework, Redux.js and Tailwind CSS to create a dynamic web app similar to Spotify that will display songs by genre, artist, or top charts.  As well, being able to play the songs with the audio player.  Shazam Core API pulls the song files and details including artist, title, album, genre as well as album artwork to be rendered into the project.  This project reinforced the React principled of props, native hooks and custom hooks.  

In this project I learned the use of APIs including Shazam Core API and IP Geolocation API.  I learned how to find and implement the boilerplate for the APIs as well as add endpoints for creating custom hooks to consume the APIs in the app.
